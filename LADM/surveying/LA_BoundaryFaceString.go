// Surveying and Representation::LA_BoundaryFaceString
//
// boundary face string: boundary (4.1.3) forming part of the outside of a spatial unit (4.1.23).
// NOTE Boundary face strings are used to represent the boundaries of spatial units by means of line strings in 2D.
// This 2D representation is a 2D boundary in a 2D land administration (4.1.10) system. In a 3D land administration system
// it represents a series of vertical boundary faces (4.1.4) where an unbounded volume is assumed, surrounded by
// boundary faces which intersect the Earthâ€™s surface (such as traditionally depicted in the cadastral map).
// An instance of class LA_BoundaryFaceString is a boundary face string. LA_BoundaryFaceString is associated
// to class LA_Point and class LA_SpatialSource to document the origin of the geometry. In the case of a
// location by text, a boundary face string would not be defined by points. However, in all other cases, a
// boundary face string shall be defined by two or more [2..*] points (i.e. as a minimum a boundary starts and
// ends at a point, i.e. a straight line).
